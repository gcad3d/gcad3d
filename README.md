## provides functions for -
>
      import and export of cad-models and pictures (bitmaps)  
      creation of geometrical objects  
      NC-working, direct and programcontrolled  
      preparation of data (building contours ..)  
      analysis of data  
      all objects can be connected with interactions  
      add-on-programs (plugins)  
      remote control  
>
  
  
## The creation of geometrical elements / NC-programs can be done by -  
>
      interactively generated geometrical objects or  
      manually generated command texts or by  
      import modules (Dxf, Iges, Step ..) or by  
      data file created by external program or by  
      special import processors (user programs)  
>
  
  
## Interactions connect to geometric objects can -  
>
      load models (like HTML - HREF)  
      activate userprograms (plugins)  
      modify the view  
      modify modelparameters dynamically  
>
  
  
## The data can be exported from the program by -  
>
      export modules ((Dxf, Iges, Vrml, Svg ..)  
      Standard - ISO - post processor  
      specialized export functions (user programs)  
      the system format APT3D (ASCII text format)  
>
  
  
## The program interface makes possible -
~~~
      The creation and analysis of geometry Objects
      interactive dialogue functions (selections..)
      automatic compiling, link and reload at execution time
