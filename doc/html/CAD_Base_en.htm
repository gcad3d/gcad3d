<h2>General format</h2>
____________________________________________________________________________

There are 2 types of codes: 

  Definition code: Generates geometric objects.
                   The format is: (name) = (parameter)
                   for example. "P20=P(100 0 0)" 
  Execution codes: State changes, which will be executed immediately
                   consist of a direct statement,
                   eg "DEFCOL 0 0 220 (default colour blue)
                   or program codes,
                   for example. "pri "P20=" P20"  


<B>Object name</B> (database ID): 
  Consists of the letters and the DB-index,
  for example: P123 is a point with the reference number 123 


<p><a name="Codeletters"></a></p>
<B>Codeletters:</B> 
A = Area (surface) 
B = Body (Solid) 
C = Circle (circle), 
D = Direction (vector) 
I = Interaction
J = Joint
L = Line 
M = Model, Sub-model, mockup model, standard part of 
N = Note, Tag, bitmap image

Example: V21 = V20 * TAN (RAD_90) 


<B>The following functions can be used:</B> 
The /X/Y/Z coordinates of a point value on: 
V21 = X(P20) 

The radius of a circle on : 
V20 = C20 

Length between 2 points: 
V20 = P20 P21 

Length of a trail: 
V20 = L20 

Normal distance of a point from a distance: 
V20 = P20 L20 

Basic account types + - / * 
V20 = 10 
V21 = V20 +10 
# result 20 
V22 = 10 + V21 * 3 
result is 70 
V22 = 10 + V21 * 3 
# result is 90  - corresponds to V22=(10+V21)*3 
V20=20*2 
# !! Error - "20*2"  or "20 * 2" 

The power function ^
V1 = 4^0.5 
# result is 2 (4 to the power 0.5) 

The mathematics functions (SQRT () SIN () COS () TAN () ASIN () ACOS () ATAN ()): 
V23 = SQRT(V22) 

Absolute value (the sign is always positive) 
V24 = ABS(V20) 

Integer - the numbers after the decimal point are removed 
V25 = FIX(1.8) 
# result is 1.0 

Rounding. 1.3 becomes 1.0, 1.8 becomes 2.0, -1.3 becomes -1.0, -1.8 becomes -2.0. 
V26=RND(V20) 

Numeric variables taken over indirectly through function VAL(); 
Example: C10=P10 VAL(C5) 
(It is the radius of the C5 over).

Endpoints of a polygon: 
P10 = S{polygon} MOD({Item Number}) 
A polygon vertex of a contour: 
P # = P(S{ccv} MOD({ccvSegNr}) MOD({polgonPtNr}))
Points within the endpoints are represented parametrically:

Point on a contour line: P = P(S{ccv} MOD({ccvSegNr}) {LPAR}) 

The point with index 0 is always the current position,
  so it can be only be used for one step.

<h2>Vector / direction</h2>
Identification key for a vector is the letter D ( "Direction"). 
____________________________________________________________________________


see also <A HREF="CAD_Vec_en.htm">CAD functions vector/direction,</A> 
see also <A HREF="#D_Copy">vector from copyfunction</A> 




A vector defines a direction and is not bound to any position. 
representation of vectors:
  - vectors are only temporarily displayed, 
  - Always in the center of the picture. 
  - Normalized vectors (with length 1) in black, otherwise red. 

The following are standard vectors: 
  DX DY DZ 
  according to standard axis directions; 
  DIX DIY DIZ 
  correspond to the inverse standard axis directions 

Definition of a vector by: 
  - select a line or a circle (normal vector) 
    or a plane (normal vector) or by 2 points 
  - Selection of a vector by Page Up/Page Down (picture) keys 
  - enter a standard vector (with the keyboard:) 
    DX or DY or DZ or inverse to DIX DIY DIZ 
  - entering a vector (with the keyboard): 
  defined by entering a vector, for example, "D12" 
  by the X / Y / Z-components, "0,0,1" defines a Z-vector 
  by one or two angles (rotateangle, tiltangle)


The last parameter may be "REV" (vector is shown reverse). 

As the penultimate parameter the vector length can be specified. 
  Example: "DX 2" or "DX 2 REV"


<U>For example:</U> 
# vector 1 = direction negative X-axis 
D1 = DIX 
# 2 = vector in direction x = 1, y = 1 in the XY plane 
D2 = D(1 1 0)

These formats are generated from selection functions: 
# vector of line:

# vector of polygon segment 
# or vector of line in a CCV: 
D ((obj) MOD ((segment number))) 

# vector of line in a vector CCV 
# or polygon segment in a CCV: 
P ((obj) MOD({CCV-segment number}) MOD({segment-number})) 
<U>Example:</U> # vector from 1.segment the CCV S26 (one line):

  First rotate around Z-axis, then around the new Y-axis.
  ANG(0) ANG(0)      - gives Vector 1,0,0
  ANG(90) ANG(0)     - gives Vector 0,1,0
  ANG(90) ANG(30)    - gives Vector 0,0.9,0.5
  ANG(180) ANG(30)   - gives Vector -0.9,0,0.5

D5 = P1 P2 100
D5 is a vector route from P1 to P2. Length optional


D6 = L10 100 
  Vector in the direction of the line. Length is optional. 
Main/sub-axis of Circ, ellipse, Plane through Modifier:

  4 = inverse X-axis 
  5 = inverse Y-axis 
Example: 
D20 = C20 MOD(2) 
  provides the X-axis of the C20 
Normal vectors:

D = Plane 
D = Point Point Point 
D = Line Line

<p><a name="CWCCW"></a></p>
<B>Rotation </B>
 CW      (clockwise) or 
 CCW     (counter-clockwise) 
 The specification of CCW is not required (default). 
 The rotation results in plan view of the axis of rotation 
 as seen by the eye of the beholder. 


<p><a name="ANGR"></a></p>
<B>Rotation angle (Rotate) </B>
 The rotation is around the Z-axis of the active construction plane. 
 Input directly: Angle 
 Enter indirectly: ANG(angle) 
 Output format: ANG(angle ()), for example: 
 ANG(30) - rotation by 30 degrees 
 # Angle value 
 ANG (angle value [REV]) 
 # Direction vector 
 ANG (D [ANG () / REV]) 
 # Line (direction) 
 ANG (L [ANG () / REV]) 
 # 2 Points (direction) 
 ANG (P P [ANG () / REV]) 
In CAD mode, the PgUp / PgDown button can add together one additional (relative) 
 angle value of about +90 degrees. (There must have been a prior 
 selection to indicate direction (eg select a line)). 



<p><a name="ANGT"></a></p>
<B>Tilt angle</B>
The rotation (tilting) is done to the new Y-axis created by a rotation of the Z-axis. 
 A tilt angle of 90 degrees provides the Z-axis (independent from the angle of rotation). 
 
Output format: ANG({angle}), for example: 
 ANG(30) - rotation by 30 degrees 
Example of rotate and tilt: 
 ANG(90) ANG(30) 
 There the object is rotated 90 degrees around the Z axis; 
 The horizontal axis now corresponds to the old X-axis, tilt axis at this 
 tilt is now around 30 degrees. 
 A negative tilt angle rotates in the opposite direction.
